# Comparing Employment Rates Between Edison, NJ and Baltimore, MD # 


## Background ##
Given the recent pandemic, an increased focus has been placed on the issue of employment, as transitions to remote work and social distancing have sidelined many industries. The national unemployment rate was last recorded at [6.7%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273909/seasonally-adjusted-monthly-unemployment-rate-in-the-us/) (December 2020), which is close to the unemployment rate recorded in December of 2008, [7.2%](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2009/jan/wk2/art02.htm?view_full) , during the early stages of the recession and housing market collapse. Unemployment and job growth rates offer a metric for examining economic opportunity in an area and understanding their variations can offer insights as to what employment opportunities are available to inhabitants and how accessible they are.

While this metric can be used to examine any inhabited area, how might it differ between metropolitan and suburban areas, and what implications do these variances have? Baltimore, MD currently has a population of approximately 600,000 people, while Edison, NJ has a population of approximately 100,000 people. Baltimore offers proximity to Washington D.C. while Edison offers proximity to New York City; what opportunities are present in these areas and could they be related to nearby hubs? We will utilize open data from The Opportunity Atlas to explore the range of job growth rates in Baltimore, MD, and Edison, NJ and see what implications these findings may have on inhabitants in these areas.

## Findings 
The data analysis revealed that job growth rates have a similar distribution in Edison and Baltimore. Although Baltimore had many more census tracts surveyed, the relative distribution shown in the graphs have similar shapes. The highest value in Baltimore is signficantly higher than Edison but both areas have similar lowest values. This indicates that both areas have similar baselines for growth while Baltimore has more opportunities for job growth overall. This could be attributed to the size of each area, given the difference in population and type of area. This finding makes sense given that Edison is primarily suburban and Baltimore is metropolitan urban. Additionally, recent efforts to [expand jobs in industries like business and hospitality](https://www.dllr.state.md.us/whatsnews/mlr.shtml) can account for the increased rates.
