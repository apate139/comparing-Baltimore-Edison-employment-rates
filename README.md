# Comparing Employment Rates Between Edison,NJ and Baltimore,MD # 


## Background ##
Given the recent pandemic, an increased focus has been placed on the issue of employment, as transitions to remote work and social distancing have sidelined many industries. The national unemployment rate was last recorded at [6.7%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273909/seasonally-adjusted-monthly-unemployment-rate-in-the-us/) (December 2020), which is close to the unemployment rate recorded in December of 2008, [7.2%](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2009/jan/wk2/art02.htm?view_full) , during the early stages of the recession and housing market collapse. Unemployment and employment rates offer a metric for examining economic opportunity in an area and understanding their variations can offer insights as to what opportunities are available to inhabitants and how accessible they are.
While this metric can be used to examine any inhabited area, how might it differ between metropolitan and suburban areas, and what implications do these variances have? Baltimore, MD currently has a population of approximately 600,000 people, while Edison, NJ has a population of approximately 100,000 people. Baltimore offers proximity to Washington D.C. while Edison offers proximity to New York City; these contrasts parallels offer an interesting opportunity for further examination. We will utilize open data from The Opportunity Atlas to determine how employment rates compare between Baltimore, MD, and Edison, NJ and what implications these findings may have on inhabitants in these areas. 

## Business Question 
How do unemployment rates compare between suburban and metropolitan areas, specifically Baltimore, MD and Edison, NJ?

## Data Sources 
[Opportunity Atlas Data](https://github.com/apate139/comparing-Baltimore-Edison-employment-rates/blob/main/tract_working_rP_gP_pall.csv)
This Excel file contains raw data obtained from the Opportunity Atlas and lists the employment rates for each tract within Baltimore, MD and Edison, NJ. It also contains analyzed data, charts, and figures produced from data analysis that show the distribution of employment rates by tract within each area. These analyses are found under sheets 'Baltimore' and 'Edison' respectively. 

## Data Analysis Figures  
In this analysis, employment rates were explored as a metric. Graphs depicting the distribution of employment rates by tract were created from the data and show how employment rates vary throughout Baltimore and Edison.

In this graph, areas where the employment rates are added as part of the same tract have higher employment rates, but similar breakdowns as tracts with single rates. The lowest value in this dataset is 0.603, while the highest is 0.87. 

## Findings 
The data analysis revealed that employment rates are similar in Baltimore and Edison, despite differences in their population size and general location. They show that Baltimore and Edison share similar trends in employment rates, although they have different ranges for employment rates and distriubtions within the tracts. The distribution of employment rates between the tracts in each area was similar, although Baltimore has more values towards the lower end of the range. Additional data that included more tracts within Edison could provide for more detailed analysis and potentially data indicating the type of employment individuals currently have could provide a better indication of the economic opportunities currently available in each area. This would allow for better recommendations towards economic policies designed to improve employment and increase equitable access to employment services across different states.
