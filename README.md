# Comparing Employment Rates Between Edison,NJ and Baltimore,MD # 


## Background ##
Given the recent pandemic, an increased focus has been placed on the issue of unemployment, as transitions to remote work and social distancing have sidelined many industries. The national unemployment rate was last recorded at [6.7%] (https://www.statista.com/statistics/273909/seasonally-adjusted-monthly-unemployment-rate-in-the-us/) (December 2020), which is close to the unemployment rate recorded in December of 2008, [7.2%] (https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2009/jan/wk2/art02.htm?view_full) , during the early stages of the recession and housing market collapse. Employment rates offer a metric for examining economic opportunity in an area and understanding their variations can offer insights as to what opportunities are available to inhabitants and how accessible they are.
While this metric can be used to examine any inhabited area, how might it differ between metropolitan and suburban areas, and what implications do these variances have? Baltimore, MD currently has a population of approximately 600,000 people, while Edison, NJ has a population of approximately 100,000 people. Baltimore offers proximity to Washington D.C. while Edison offers proximity to New York City; these contrasts parallels offer an interesting opportunity for further examination. We will utilize open data from The Opportunity Atlas to determine how employment rates compare between Baltimore, MD, and Edison, NJ and what implications these findings may have on inhabitants in these areas.
